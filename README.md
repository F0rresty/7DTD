7 days to die save

Add the folder "Kubixe County" to file path AppData/Roaming/7DaysToDie/Mods/Saves (Or whatever equivalent). Kubixe County is the generated world name, the game should recognize this. This folder has our save Zomb munchers with everything in it. 

If for some reason there are issues, I suspect you may need the world generation file for Kubix County, that file would go in mods/GeneratedWorlds.
